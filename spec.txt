We'll write a web app called 'Learning Log' which allows users to log the topics they're interested in/about &
make entries for each topic and as they learn about each topic.
The Home page will describe the site and invite users to either register or log in.
Once logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.
